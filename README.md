# Protocols for dry lab experiments <!-- omit in toc -->

Descriptive protocols for different types of dry-lab processes. This page serves as the main repository for the raw and supplementary protocol files. In order to view the html notebook versions, please visit the protocols page on my [GitHub homepage](https://chrishuges.github.io/protocols/).

## Troubleshooting

While these protocols have been validated to work in my hands, use at your own risk. If you have any issues or notice errors in anything that you find here, feel free to make a post in the [Issues](https://github.com/chrishuges/dryLabProtocols/issues) and I will do my best to address it.
