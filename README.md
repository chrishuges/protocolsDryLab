# Protocols for dry lab experiments <!-- omit in toc -->

Descriptive protocols for different types of dry-lab processes. The majority of the files are provided as R notebook html files, for ease of visualization. However, Rmd files are provided for all tutorials that can be downloaded and opened on your own machine to follow along if you would like. To download one of the Rmd files, simply navigate to the top level directory for the protocol you are interested in, click on the Rmd file you would like to download, click the 'Raw' button on the file that appears, and right click and hit 'Save As' on the new page that opens. Save the file as an Rmd file and open in RStudio.

In most of these protocols I use R, but some use Python (sometimes in the same notebook). In these instances, I do my best to detail my choice for one vs. the other, and what I am doing.

## Troubleshooting

While these protocols have been validated to work in my hands, use at your own risk. If you have any issues or notice errors in anything that you find here, feel free to make a post in the [Issues](https://github.com/chrishuges/dryLabProtocols/issues) and I will do my best to address it.
