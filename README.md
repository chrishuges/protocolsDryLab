# Protocols for dry lab experiments <!-- omit in toc -->

Descriptive protocols for different types of dry-lab processes. PDF versions of all protocols are available for download in the same directory where the protocol is found. For protocols with code blocks, the PDF version may have some of the code cut off for long lines, so I suggest you refer to the markdown version in these cases. Some protocols also provide R notebook (Rmd and html) files that you can directly plug in to RStudio if you desire. To download these for use on your own machine, simply click the link to the file and when it opens, hit the 'Raw' button. One the screen that appears right click and hit 'Save as', and save to your own machine with the correct extension for the file you are downloading.

## Troubleshooting

While these protocols have been validated to work in my hands, use at your own risk. If you have any issues or notice errors in anything that you find here, feel free to make a post in the [Issues](https://github.com/chrishuges/dryLabProtocols/issues) and I will do my best to address it.
